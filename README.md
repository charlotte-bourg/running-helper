## Use Case Background
Background
- Strava says they're the world's #1 fitness app, used by hobbyists to elite athletes for tracking and sharing workout data
- Strava can help users track mileage on their shoes by associating shoes worn with an activity
- Tracking mileage helps runners know when to replace a pair of shoes, which can prevent injuries
- Strava allows setting a pair of shoes as a default for a given activity type (e.g. hike, run, or trail run)

Challenge: 
- Many athletes keep multiple pairs of shoes in rotation for a given activity type, as rotating shoes has been shown to be associated with lower injury risk 
- Many athletes don't record activities directly on Strava but rather use smart watches to track their runs and set up an automatic sync from their wearable to Strava
- When data syncs to Strava it can be easy to ignore it altogether and leave the default gear or to review detailed workout stats in accordance with a training plan or goals and then forget to update the gear 

Solution:
- Use this web app to sign up for alerts to keep your gear mileage accurate!
